## Description
- In order to meet the faster needs of the financial industry, reading report manually could be unrealisticâ€”especially with higher and faster request of financial activities. However, recent LLM that traders can directly interact is flawed: they are providing wrong answers, they are not providing consistent answers for a solid question, and they make data up.
- The solution here is to combine the power of LLM and the realistic reports. While human is not able to read through documentations just for some numbers, AI will help us out to navigate/spot out that number. This solution provides quick and precise Q&A services for users, because they are reading the true documentation for reference instead of making things up, and they are predicting the trend, providing the hint for trades based on real-time data from API of different financial platforms.
- The technologies used here is simple: we are using blur match to get the answer, but the model aligns with the true data that we can get from reports and real-time markets. In this case, the usability of AI tool in Finance could dramatically increase.
